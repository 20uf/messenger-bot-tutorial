🤖  Creating your own Facebook Messenger bot in 15 minutes

Facebook recently opened up their Messenger platform to enable bots to respond and have conversations with users through Facebook Apps and on Facebook Pages. 

You can read how to the  [documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/quickstart) the Messenger team prepared but honestly it's not very clear for beginners and intermediate hackers. 

Instead I'll explain how to create your own messenger bot up and running in 10 minutes.

## 🙌  Get set
